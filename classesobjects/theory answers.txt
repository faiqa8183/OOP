four principles of oop are : abstraction,encapsulation , polymorphism and inheritance 
abstraction in simple words is that one class created in the code should be familiar of the attributes of the other class 
it hide unnecessary details  
encapsulation some class members are only accessible by the class only i.e they are private 
but some are accessible outside the class i.e public members
polymorphism classes with same name performing but performing different tasks i.e function over riding 
inheritance if classes in child parent relationship , i.e private members of the child can be accessed by the child indirectly
